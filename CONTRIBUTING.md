# Contributing to One-Pager Assistant

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

## Development Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/one-pager.git`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Pre-commit hooks are automatically installed via npm install

## Code Quality Standards

All contributions must meet these standards:

### Linting
- **ESLint**: Code must pass ESLint checks
- Run: `npm run lint`
- Auto-fix: `npm run lint:fix`

### Testing
- **Jest**: All tests must pass
- **Coverage**: New code must maintain 73%+ coverage
- Run: `npm test`
- Coverage: `npm run test:coverage`

### Pre-Commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks automatically enforce these standards. They run on every commit.

To run manually:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Testing

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in `tests/` directory
- Name test files `*.test.js`
- Use Jest and ES6 modules
- Mock browser APIs (IndexedDB, etc.) using fake-indexeddb
- Aim for high coverage of new code

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run specific test file
npm test -- tests/specific.test.js
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`

3. Ensure all tests pass: `npm test`
4. Ensure linting passes: `npm run lint`
5. Ensure pre-commit hooks pass: `pre-commit run --all-files`
6. Commit your changes (pre-commit hooks will run automatically)
7. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
8. Open a Pull Request
